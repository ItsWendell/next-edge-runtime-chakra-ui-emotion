# Example app with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) and TypeScript, and Next.js Edge Runtime

This example features how to use [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app with TypeScript, using the [Next.js Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18/switchable-runtime)

Next.js and chakra-ui have built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for their modules straight away.

This repository is meant to show-case how to work with the Next.js Edge Runtime and Emotion, and to detect since issues since the Edge Runtime is still experiment.
